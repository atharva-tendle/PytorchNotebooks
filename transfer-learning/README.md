# CNN Transfer Learning flower image dataset
* This notebook was created during my Deep Learning Nanodegree course (UDACITY).
* This notebook implements a CNN Classifier using Transfer Learning in Pytorch.
* The classifier uses a VGG16 as the feature extractor and then a linear layer for classification.
* The classifier is trained on a dataset of flowers.
